Note that applications will be evaluated based on the following criteria, so please take time and care to answer the free text questions:

* demonstration of need
* existing knowledge gap
* potential impact of training


This training is designed to introduce librarians and information specialists to the R programming language using RStudio, with a particular focus on using R for evidence synthesis, thus **the primary audience for this training is information specialists and librarians actively involved in supporting evidence synthesis**. [*litsearchr*](https://elizagrames.github.io/litsearchr/) is an R package designed to assist in term harvesting and search strategy development. You will gain hands-on experience with these tools, providing a foundation for building your coding skills, automating aspects of search strategy development and generating reproducible code for evidence synthesis projects. 

The [curriculum for this workshop](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/lc-litsearchr/) is openly available and is being developed as a lesson for [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/).
