## Introduction to R, RStudio and *litsearchr* Virtual Workshop

### About this workshop

We are pleased to offer a virtual, hands-on training over two half-days on R, RStudio and *litsearchr*. This training will be held April 20-21, 2023 from 2-5pm EDT. 

**We are now accepting applications with a deadline of March 15, 2023. To apply, fill out [this application form](https://forms.gle/mzhMzV1BM2UEEMYBA).**

Applications will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* demonstration of need
* existing knowledge gap
* potential impact of training


This training is designed to introduce librarians and information specialists to the R programming language using RStudio, with a particular focus on using R for evidence synthesis. [*litsearchr*](https://elizagrames.github.io/litsearchr/) is an R package designed to assist in term harvesting and search strategy development. You will gain hands-on experience with these tools, providing a foundation for building your coding skills, automating aspects of search strategy development and generating reproducible code for evidence synthesis projects. 

The [curriculum for this workshop](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/lc-litsearchr/) is openly available and is being developed as a lesson for [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/).
